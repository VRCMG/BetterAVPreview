## Special Thanks
Special thanks to gompo <3 (https://github.com/gompocp) that's really helped me a LOT with his enourmous brain. 
And thanks to the entire modding community in general for inspiring me to get interested on C# and helping me to learn and solve my mistakes :)

## BetterAVPreview
Current features:
- Facial expressions;
- Changing states like clothes and colors;
- Simple rotation mechanism with sliders;
- Integration with ActionMenu.

To do:
- Fix bug that when u use the av preview ur avatar expressions wont work (local)
- Fix bug that the actionmenu keeps opened on the expressions page, leading to it not updating until closing and opening the page again
- See if fixing the shaders glitch is possible
- Implement pop-up to better preview
- Wait for louky to finish rotator to use his instead of my current one
- See if it's possible to use animations
- Implement for av2.0

## Installation
Before installing:  
**Modding itself is against VRChat's ToS, so, according to the staff, it can lead to punishment, this mod included. Be careful while using this! I'm not responsible for any punishments.**

You will need [MelonLoader](https://discord.gg/2Wn3N2P) (discord link, see \#how-to-install).
After that, drop the mod .dll file in the `Mods` folder in your game's directory.
