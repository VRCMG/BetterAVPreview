## Special Thanks
Special thanks to gompo <3 (https://github.com/gompocp) that's really helped me a LOT with his enourmous brain. 
And thanks to the entire modding community in general for inspiring me to get interested on C# and helping me to learn and solve my mistakes :)

## AVPreview 3.0
Features:
 * Still in progress :)

## Installation
Before installing:  
**Modding itself is against VRChat's ToS, so, according to the staff, it can lead to punishment, these mods included. Be careful while using these! I'm not responsible for any punishments.**

You will need [MelonLoader](https://discord.gg/2Wn3N2P) (discord link, see \#how-to-install).
After that, drop the mods .dll files in the `Mods` folder in your game's directory.
