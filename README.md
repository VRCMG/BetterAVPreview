## Special Thanks
Special thanks to gompo <3 (https://github.com/gompocp) that's really helped me a LOT with his enourmous brain. 
And thanks to the entire modding community in general for inspiring me to get interested on C# and helping me to learn and solve my mistakes :)

## BetterAVPreview
Current features:
- Facial expressions;
- Dynamic Bones;
- Changing states like clothes and colors;
- Integration with ActionMenu;
- Scuffed and simple rotation mechanism with sliders (very glitched and unreliable for now xd).

To do:
- Wait for louky to finish rotator to use his instead of my current one;
- See if fixing the shaders (layers?) glitch is possible;
- See if it's possible to use animations;
- Implement pop-up to better preview;
- Finish implementing for 2.0;

## Installation
Before installing:  
**Modding itself is against VRChat's ToS, so, according to the staff, it can lead to punishment, this mod included. Be careful while using this! I'm not responsible for any punishments.**

You will need [MelonLoader](https://discord.gg/2Wn3N2P) (discord link, see \#how-to-install).
After that, drop the mod .dll file in the `Mods` folder in your game's directory.
